.files used by myself

Usage
========

It's better to clone with recursive option to not to forget about git submodules:

```bash
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/webdizz/dotfiles .dotfiles
    ./script/setup
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)" # for Ubuntu
```

TODO

Consider http://www.hammerspoon.org/go/ as depicted http://brettterpstra.com/2016/09/29/a-better-hyper-key-hack-for-sierra/ instead of outdated mattr-slate.
